- traversing through screen of records removes all the field label, fix!
- input attributes hide all but first character, why? (this is related to %CSUP settings)
- DCS P-params -- can we embed HTML5 and JS code in Terminal Renderer?
- fixed terminal size, just zooming as per window size -- calculate font size based on cols, rows, and screen size
- file transfers (can be sorted on server-side, showing remote file listing pane next to the terminal)
- DECSWL, DECDWL, DECDHL: can we use different font sizes?
- unimplemented status CSIs?
