- report a bug -- removed labels while traversing records on the screen
- report a bug -- terminal sometimes becomes irresponsive (not receiving
  or sending any websocket data, not even echoing input, not throwing
  errors on the client side... should we implement some kind of
  heartbeat? (that would require encapsulating terminal traffic by
  a header indicating message type [io|hb])

- draw graphics (buttons) -- a good start can be to support named links
- fixed terminal size, just zooming as per window size -- keep the same
  COLxROW ratio, just scale (changing number of cols will still fit into
  the parent container)

- input attributes hide all but first character, why? (this is related to %CSUP settings)
- DCS P-params -- can we embed HTML5 and JS code in Terminal Renderer?
- file transfers (can be sorted on server-side, showing remote file listing pane next to the terminal)
- unimplemented status CSIs?
